# Research Manager Journal & Strategic State

## 1. High-Level Strategy & Trajectory
*   **Current Phase:** Phase 1 (Representation Base - Verification of Pillars A, B, C).
*   **Active Direction:** Hardening the representation base against dimensional collapse and fixing the GDASR triggering dynamics.
*   **Confidence Score:** 75% (decreased from 100% due to the discovery of latent collapse and buffer inflation, but with a highly structured path to correction).

## 2. Strategic Insights & Lessons Learned
*   **Historical Buffer Inflation:** Including initialization transients in the running surprise error buffer artificially inflates the recruitment threshold. This masks genuine physical novelty (N=3 to N=4 transition). A sliding-window buffer or a transient-blanking period is a mandatory architectural constraint for any surprise-driven recruitment mechanism.
*   **Covariance Deficit in 1D Dynamics:** In a 1D continuous physics sandbox, temporal transitions of objects are highly correlated. Standard VICReg hyperparameter ratios (e.g., matching variance and covariance penalties) fail; the covariance penalty must be heavily scaled up (e.g., $Cov\_weight \ge 25.0$) relative to variance and similarity to prevent collapse onto a redundant, collinear 1D manifold.
*   **Representational Collapse Default:** Representational collapse in low-dimensional physical systems is the thermodynamic default. Unless explicit, highly asymmetric constraints or aggressive covariance penalties are enforced, the network will exploit redundant dimensions to minimize surprise trivially.

## 3. Loop & Bottleneck Detection
*   **Identified Bottleneck:** The interaction between representation collapse and surprise calculation creates a dead loop. If the latent space collapses, surprise becomes low or constant, which subsequently disables the GDASR trigger and prevents any downstream thalamic gating from functioning.
*   **Mitigation Strategy:** The Planner must prioritize hardening the representation base before adding more complex components (like Thalamic Gating). Specifically:
    1. Implement a temporal blanking window ($t < 50$ steps) or a sliding-window FIFO buffer for surprise thresholding.
    2. Run a controlled parameter sweep on the Covariance-to-Variance ratio ($Cov\_weight \in [1.0, 50.0]$) to establish the boundary of representation collapse.

## 4. Alternate Research Paths
*   **Asymmetric Target Networks (BYOL-style):** If covariance tuning does not stably resolve representation collapse across diverse environmental parameters, pivot immediately to an asymmetric online/target network design with stop-gradients as the primary anti-collapse mechanism.
*   **Statistical Outlier Detection:** Replace the running-mean surprise threshold with a robust statistical measure (such as Median Absolute Deviation) to prevent scale-inflation by transient spikes.
