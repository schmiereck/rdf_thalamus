## Iteration 003 -> Manager [Proposed Research Plan]

**Proposed Hypothesis:**
Increasing the VICReg covariance regularization weight to 25.0, in conjunction with a 1000-step representation-warmup phase, will prevent representation collapse (reducing the mean absolute cross-dimension correlation $r$ from >0.99 to <0.30). Furthermore, replacing the cumulative error buffer with a rolling sliding-window error buffer of size 500 (cleared post-warmup) will enable sensitive and reliable recruitment of a new dimension (recruitment rate >80%) when transitioning from 2 to 3 objects in the 1D physics sandbox, without increasing the temporal prediction simulation loss compared to the baseline B1.

**Proposed Falsification Criterion:**
The hypothesis will be falsified if any of the following occur:
1. The mean absolute correlation ($r$) between representation dimensions is >= 0.30 at the end of training.
2. The dynamic recruitment rate for the GDASR model upon the N=3 object transition is <= 80%.
3. The final temporal prediction simulation loss of the recruiting DynamicJEPA model is > 0.080 (or more than 10% worse than the non-recruiting B1 baseline of 0.06662).

**Proposed Method:**
1. Modify the training and model configuration files (e.g., in `src/`) to increase `cov_weight` from 1.0 to 25.0 in the VICReg loss calculation.
2. Implement a representation-warmup phase of 1000 steps during which gradient updates are performed normally but dimension recruitment is disabled.
3. Replace the cumulative error buffer in the GDASR recruitment module with a rolling sliding-window buffer of size 500.
4. Programmatically reset/clear this error buffer immediately following the warmup phase and during the transition from N=2 to N=3 objects.
5. Run the full evaluation suite of 15 experiments (DynamicJEPA, B1, and B2 across 5 deterministic seeds) on the 1D physics sandbox.
6. Measure and log: mean absolute correlation between dimensions, recruitment rate upon N=3 transition, and final temporal prediction simulation loss.

## Iteration 003 -> Planner [Strategic Guidance]

### Manager's Note: Strategic Guidance & Architectural Constraints

We are at a critical juncture in establishing a stable Phase 1 representation base. Your proposed adjustments address the primary failure modes of the previous run (threshold inflation and representation collapse), but the current experimental design contains a significant scientific vulnerability and an unfair baseline control. 

Please adjust your plan according to the following directives before writing the pre-registration file:

---

### 1. The Transition-Reset Construction Trap (Skeptic Mode)
* **The Issue:** Your proposed method states: *"Programmatically reset/clear this error buffer immediately following the warmup phase **and during the transition from N=2 to N=3 objects**."*
* **The Critique:** Manually resetting the buffer at the exact boundary of the physical transition injects **oracle knowledge** into the agent. If the system requires an external signal to clear its memory to detect a change, the recruitment is constructional (engineered), not empirical (emergent). The agent must detect the unexpected transition purely through the natural dynamics of its sliding-window buffer. 
* **Correction:** You are permitted to reset the buffer once immediately after the **warmup phase** (to clear random initialization transients). You are **strictly forbidden** from programmatically resetting or altering the buffer or threshold during the N=2 to N=3 transition. The sliding window of size 500 must discard the older, lower-error history naturally.

### 2. Control Group Hygiene (Baseline Alignment)
* **The Issue:** If you change `cov_weight` to 25.0 and introduce a 1000-step representation-warmup phase *only* for the `DynamicJEPA` model, your comparison against Baseline B1 is invalid. Any improvement in representation collapse ($r < 0.30$) or degradation in loss could be attributed entirely to the hyperparameter tuning, rather than the recruitment mechanism.
* **Correction:** **Baseline B1 (and B2, where mathematically applicable) must be trained under the exact same hyperparameter envelope**—specifically, the same `cov_weight = 25.0` and the same 1000-step warmup (even if B1 does not recruit, its weights must undergo the same warmup phase kinetics). This isolates "dynamic recruitment" as the sole independent variable.

### 3. Quantitative Pre-Registration Mandate
* Your stated quantitative falsification criteria are excellent and rigorous. 
* **Action:** Before executing any training runs, ensure these exact hypotheses and criteria (incorporating the corrections above) are committed to `src/pre_registration.md`. Your sub-agents must read and strictly adhere to this file during execution. 

Proceed with these corrections. Let's see if the representation base can be genuinely hardened under fair, unassisted conditions.
