## Iteration 002 -> Manager [Proposed Research Plan]

**Proposed Hypothesis:**
A Dynamic Representation Network (Thalamus Phase 1) using Gradient-Driven Active Subspace Recruitment (GDASR) combined with VICReg-style anti-collapse regularization will:
1. Dynamically recruit new representational dimensions (incrementing active dimension count $d_t$) when transitioned from a low-complexity training environment (2 objects) to a high-complexity evaluation environment (3 objects) in a 1D physics sandbox.
2. Achieve a post-recruitment temporal prediction error on the 3-object environment that is at least 30% lower than a fixed-dimensional Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (Baseline B1 with fixed $d_t = 2$) trained under identical conditions.
3. Avoid representation collapse, maintaining a latent standard deviation of $\sigma > 0.1$ for all active dimensions and an average absolute cross-dimension correlation of $r < 0.3$.

**Proposed Falsification Criterion:**
The hypothesis will be proven false if any of the following conditions are met:
1. The dynamic representation network fails to recruit any new dimension (remains at $d_{\text{init}} = 2$) within 5000 steps of exposure to the 3-object environment.
2. The mean temporal prediction error of the dynamic network on the 3-object environment after adaptation is NOT at least 30% lower than that of the fixed-dimensional baseline (B1).
3. The representations collapse during training or evaluation, defined as any active dimension having a standard deviation $\sigma \le 0.1$ or the average absolute correlation between active dimensions being $r \ge 0.3$ across the evaluation batch.

**Proposed Method:**
1. Implement a 1D physics sandbox (`src/environment.py`) generating a 1D array of 128 RGB pixels, simulating N elastic colliding objects with randomized sizes, colors, masses, and initial velocities, with parameterizable N.
2. Implement `src/models.py` containing:
   - An Encoder (CNN/MLP) outputting up to $D_{\max} = 8$ dimensions, with only the first $d_t$ dimensions active.
   - A Predictor (MLP or lightweight GRU) forecasting the active latent states $\hat{z}_{t+1}$ from history.
   - Baseline B1 (FixedJEPA) with fixed $d_t = 2$ and VICReg loss.
   - DynamicJEPA implementing GDASR: starts with $d_t = 2$, tracks the exponential moving average of prediction error, and increments $d_t$ when error exceeds $\theta_{\text{recruit}}$ after a cooldown $N_{\text{cooldown}}$.
3. Create `src/train.py` to train both models first on $N=2$ objects, then transition them to $N=3$ objects.
4. Perform 5 independent runs with different random seeds to calculate the mean and standard deviation of prediction errors, dimension count, latent variance, and cross-correlations.

## Iteration 002 -> Planner [Strategic Guidance]

### Manager's Note: Strategic Guidance for Phase 1

The proposed research plan for Phase 1 is mathematically sound and structured, but it risks falling into the **Construction-vs-Empirical** trap if not executed with strict discipline. To ensure scientific rigor, apply the following guidance before proceeding to code execution.

---

### 1. The Construction-vs-Empirical Test: Functional Recruitment vs. Trivial Thresholding
*   **The Trap:** Simply incrementing the active dimension count $d_t$ when prediction error exceeds a hand-tuned threshold $\theta_{\text{recruit}}$ is a *definitional identity of your code*, not an empirical finding. 
*   **Strategic Correction:** To prove that dimension recruitment is truly functional:
    1.  **Introduce a Fixed $d=3$ Control (B1-Large):** You must compare your dynamic network not only against $B1$ (fixed $d_t=2$) but also against a model initialized with fixed $d_t=3$ from the start. If the dynamic model starting at $d_{\text{init}}=2$ and recruiting to $d_t=3$ does not show superior sample efficiency or lower final error than the fixed $d_t=3$ model, then dynamic recruitment offers no empirical benefit over simple over-parameterization.
    2.  **Orthogonality of Recruited Dimensions:** You must log the projection of the new dimensions onto the existing subspace. If the newly recruited dimension is highly correlated with existing ones, it is a redundant projection, not a new representational channel.

### 2. Parameter-Tuning Hygiene: Adaptive Thresholds over Post-Hoc Tuning
*   **The Trap:** Tuning a static threshold $\theta_{\text{recruit}}$ *after* observing the baseline error curves on the 3-object environment is a violation of scientific hygiene (post-hoc parameter tuning).
*   **Strategic Correction:** You must define an **adaptive, self-normalizing recruitment criterion** in `src/pre_registration.md`. For example, trigger recruitment when the prediction error exceeds $k$ standard deviations of the *moving average of the stable 2-object error*, where $k$ is fixed *a priori*. Do not manually tweak $\theta_{\text{recruit}}$ during your runs to "force" recruitment. If the model fails to recruit under the pre-registered adaptive rule, report it honestly as a null result.

### 3. Pre-Registration Mandate & Metric Bounds
*   **The Protocol:** The Orchestrator will automatically commit your proposed hypotheses and falsification criteria to `src/pre_registration.md` before execution begins. All sub-agents must read and strictly adhere to this file during training and evaluation.
*   **Rigor Check:** Your collapse criteria ($\sigma > 0.1$, $r < 0.3$) are acceptable quantitative bounds. However, ensure that $\sigma$ is calculated on *normalized* latent states (e.g., after VICReg variance regularization) to prevent the network from trivially satisfying the variance constraint by scaling the weight magnitudes of the active dimensions.

---

**Proceed to write the `src/pre_registration.md` and implement the 1D physics sandbox (`src/environment.py`) incorporating these strict controls.**
