# RDF Milestone Review — Iteration 002 — GDASR Trigger Failure & Latent Collapse

## 1. Pre-Declared Hypothesis and Falsification Criterion
- **Hypothesis:** The GDASR (Gated Dynamic Dimension Allocation with Surprise-driven Recruitment) mechanism will successfully recruit new latent dimensions when transitioning from $N=3$ to $N=4$ objects, and the VICReg loss with default weight ratios (Sim=25, Var=25, Cov=1) will prevent representation collapse.
- **Falsification Criterion:** GDASR fails to recruit dimensions upon introduction of the novel object ($N=4$), or the representation collapses (measured by the effective rank of the latent covariance matrix approaching $1.0$).

## 2. Experimental Protocol
- **Environment:** 1D physics sandbox with parameterizable environmental variation.
- **Input:** 128-channel 1D RGB pixel grid containing moving physical objects.
- **Training Regime:** Passive observation; transition from $N=3$ to $N=4$ objects at mid-run.
- **Hyperparameters:** Sim_weight = 25.0, Var_weight = 25.0, Cov_weight = 1.0.
- **Control Run:** Baseline B1-JEPA (fixed dimensionality without GDASR) under identical parameter conditions.

## 3. Observed Quantities
- **GDASR Recruitment Rate:** 0% (failed to trigger any dimension recruitment upon introducing the 4th object).
- **Surprise Error Buffer:** Inflated threshold due to inclusion of initialization transients ($t < 50$), masking late-stage surprise changes.
- **Latent Manifold Dimensionality:** Latent representations collapsed onto a redundant, collinear 1D manifold (effective rank $\approx 1.0$), as the covariance weight of 1.0 was completely dominated by variance and similarity terms (ratio 1:25).

## 4. Verdict
**Refuted.** The pre-declared hypothesis that the initial parameterization of GDASR and VICReg would maintain stable, expandable representations is refuted.

## 5. Construction-vs-Empirical Note
The collapse to a 1D manifold is an empirical behavior of the interaction between the 1D physics environment dynamics and the VICReg loss function when the covariance penalty is insufficiently weighted. It is not an algebraic identity, as the latent space construction allowed for up to 8 independent dimensions.

## 6. Limitations
This result demonstrates that standard VICReg weight configurations are highly unstable in 1D continuous physics tracking where spatial dynamics are heavily correlated. It does not prove that VICReg or GDASR are fundamentally non-viable, but highlights that:
1. Dynamic threshold systems must use adaptive sliding-window buffers to filter out initial transient errors.
2. Covariance regularization must be scaled significantly higher than variance (e.g., $Cov\_weight \ge 25.0$) to overcome collinearity in low-dimensional continuous physical trajectories.
