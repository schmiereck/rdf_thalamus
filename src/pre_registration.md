## 1. Hypothesis
On the existing NonParametricJEPASpatial CNN encoder with frozen d_t=3 and no dynamic
recruitment, replacing the JEPA prediction objective with SFA (slowness) on z_dyn as the
primary representation objective, combined with batch VICReg on z_dyn, will:
(1) Train without representation collapse (all per-dimension std >= 0.5, no has_collapsed trigger),
(2) Achieve centroid-decoding MSE via Arm F (soft-argmax on z_coord) at most 10% higher
    than the JEPA+VICReg baseline (i.e., MSE_SFA <= 1.10 * MSE_JEPA, where MSE_JEPA ~ 55.6),
(3) Produce z_dyn representations that are significantly slower (mean ||z_dyn(t) - z_dyn(t-1)||^2
    at least 40% lower) than z_coord temporal variation, indicating that SFA separates slow
    identity from fast position by construction.
(4) Exhibit semantic disentanglement: delta_R2_color = R2_dyn_color - R2_coord_color >= 0.10,
    indicating that z_dyn predicts object color (identity) better than z_coord, while
    z_coord remains primarily position-coded.

## 2. Falsification Criterion
The hypothesis is falsified if ANY of the following hold across the 5-seed sweep:
C1 (Collapse): SFA+VICReg arm collapses (has_collapsed=True OR any active dimension std < 0.5)
    in >= 2 out of 5 seeds.
C2 (Centroid MSE): Mean centroid-decoding MSE of the SFA arm exceeds 1.10 * mean MSE of the
    JEPA baseline arm (i.e., SFA degrades spatial readout by more than 10%).
C3_sanity (Slowness separation — sanity check): The ratio
    mean(||z_dyn(t)-z_dyn(t-1)||^2) / mean(||z_coord(t)-z_coord(t-1)||^2)
    is >= 0.6 for the SFA arm. This serves as a sanity check that z_dyn is substantially
    slower than z_coord, but is not itself a falsification criterion — it confirms the
    basic slowness property without requiring a specific disentanglement outcome.
C3_semantic (Semantic disentanglement — primary C3): delta_R2_color < 0.10 for the SFA arm,
    where delta_R2_color = R2_dyn_color - R2_coord_color is the difference in color-prediction
    R² between z_dyn and z_coord latent dimensions. A value >= 0.10 confirms that SFA
    meaningfully pushes identity-related features into z_dyn while keeping them out of z_coord.

## 3. Proposed Method
Step 1: Create SFA training infrastructure.
- MODIFY src/models_dual_stream.py: Add an SFA loss computation to NonParametricJEPASpatial.forward()
  that computes L_sfa = ||z_dyn_target - z_dyn_prev||^2 over the batch, where z_dyn_prev is
  z_dyn from the previous frame in the history. Also add batch VICReg on z_dyn_target (the 
  target frame's dynamics representation). The total representation loss becomes:
  L_repr = sfa_weight * L_sfa + var_weight * VICReg_var(z_dyn) + cov_weight * VICReg_cov(z_dyn)
  The JEPA sim_loss is retained ONLY as a readout/surprise signal (stop-gradient detached from
  the representation), not as a training objective for the encoder.
- Keep the predictor's forward pass for surprise computation, but detach its output from the
  encoder's gradient path when SFA is the primary objective.

Step 2: Create the Phase 0 experiment runner.
- CREATE src/run_phase0_sfa.py: A 5-seed sweep comparing three arms:
  Arm A (SFA+VICReg): Primary objective = SFA on z_dyn + batch VICReg on z_dyn.
    - sfa_weight=1.0, var_weight=25.0, cov_weight=25.0
    - Predictor is retained for surprise readout but gradients do NOT flow to encoder from sim_loss.
    - z_coord is NOT slowed (M2 mandate).
    - d_t frozen at 3, no recruitment.
  Arm B (JEPA+VICReg Baseline, B1): Same as current NonParametricJEPASpatial with
    sim_weight=25.0, var_weight=25.0, cov_weight=25.0. d_t frozen at 3, no recruitment.
    This is the direct comparison baseline.
  Arm C (SFA+VICReg with pos_encoding="sinusoidal"): Same as Arm A but with sinusoidal
    position encoding added to the input. Tests whether explicit position channels
    narrow the Spatial Specialization Gap under SFA.

Step 3: Training protocol (shared across arms).
- Environment: PhysicsSandbox(N=3, seed=seed) for 3000 training steps, batch_size=32.
- History buffer: deque(maxlen=4) for H=3 history + 1 target.
- Replay buffer: capacity 2000, prefill 100 transitions.
- Optimizer: Adam, lr=1e-3.
- d_t = 3 frozen from start (no recruitment logic).
- GDASR runs in log-only mode (computes and logs growth-point signals without modifying d_t).
- Seeds: [42, 123, 456, 789, 999].

Step 4: Evaluation protocol (at step 3000 and checkpoint at 1500).
- Non-collapse check: has_collapsed criterion + per-dimension std >= 0.5.
- Centroid decoding MSE: linear probe on soft-argmax centroids vs. true object positions
  (all 3 objects, report mean and per-object).
- Slowness metrics: mean ||z_dyn(t) - z_dyn(t-1)||^2 and mean ||z_coord(t) - z_coord(t-1)||^2
  over 200 test frames, and their ratio.
- VICReg health: per-dimension std, mean absolute correlation between active dimensions.
- GDASR growth-point log: count and timing of would-have-recruited events.

Step 5: Statistical analysis.
- Welch's t-test comparing SFA arm vs JEPA arm on centroid MSE.
- Welch's t-test comparing SFA arm z_dyn slowness ratio vs 0.6 threshold.
- Cohen's d for effect sizes.
- Report with confidence intervals per reporting standards (Section 9).

Step 6: Falsification audit against C1, C2, C3_sanity, C3_semantic.
- C1: Count collapsed seeds per arm.
- C2: Compare mean MSE_SFA vs 1.10 * mean MSE_JEPA.
- C3_sanity: Compute slowness ratio for SFA arm; check >= 0.6 (sanity check).
- C3_semantic: Compute delta_R2_color for SFA arm; check < 0.10 as falsification.

Files to create/modify:
- MODIFY: src/models_dual_stream.py (add SFA objective option to NonParametricJEPASpatial.forward)
- CREATE: src/run_phase0_sfa.py (experiment runner with 3 arms × 5 seeds)
- UPDATE: src/pre_registration.md (with Phase 0 pre-registration)
