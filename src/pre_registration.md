## 1. Hypothesis
Adding a WUP-period prediction-trend gate to WUP-MDL (creating "EG-MDL") will
maintain ≥80% recruitment rate on the N=3→4 transition sweep while reducing
the Noisy-TV false recruitment rate from 100% (WUP-MDL baseline) to ≤20%,
with centroid decoding MSE ≤ 65.0.

The prediction-trend gate computes the improvement ratio ρ = E_late / E_early
during the WUP period, where E_early and E_late are the mean prediction errors
over the first and second halves of the warm-up window. A genuine new object
produces ρ << 1.0 (predictor learning smooth dynamics), while a Noisy-TV
distractor produces ρ ≈ 1.0 (no learnable structure). The gate accepts the
dimension only if ρ < θ (θ=0.90) AND the existing MDL consistency criterion
passes.

## 2. Falsification Criterion
The EG-MDL hypothesis is falsified if ANY of the following hold across the
5-seed matched sweep:

1. Recruitment rate < 80% on the N=3→4 transition sweep (WUP-MDL baseline
   achieves 100%; allowing modest degradation from the stricter gate).
2. False recruitment rate > 20% on the Noisy-TV control sweep (WUP-MDL
   baseline achieves 100% false recruitment; this is the critical improvement
   target).
3. Mean centroid decoding MSE > 65.0 on the transition sweep (WUP-MDL
   baseline achieves 57.34; allowing modest degradation from the additional
   gate constraint).

These three criteria jointly require EG-MDL to solve BOTH the recruitment
problem (which ESUG failed at) and the distractor-rejection problem (which
WUP-MDL failed at). Improving one at the expense of the other is insufficient.

## 3. Proposed Method
Step-by-step experiment:

1. Re-implement Arm P (WUP-MDL, W=100) as the baseline from iter_017, to
   confirm reproducibility and provide a matched comparison.

2. Implement Arm S (EG-MDL, W=100, θ=0.90):
   a. During the WUP period, record per-step prediction error e[t] for the
      proposed 4th dimension.
   b. At the end of WUP (step W), compute:
      E_early = mean(e[0 : W/2])
      E_late  = mean(e[W/2 : W])
      ρ = E_late / E_early
   c. The composite gate accepts the dimension if:
      - MDL criterion: L_consistency < 1.0 (existing WUP-MDL gate)
      - Prediction-trend: ρ < 0.90 (NEW: at least 10% error reduction)
   d. If both pass, the dimension is permanently recruited.
   e. If either fails, the dimension is rejected and pruned.

3. Implement Arm T (EG-MDL-Spatial, W=100, θ=0.90, η=0.50):
   a. Same as Arm S, plus an additional spatial entropy gate.
   b. Compute spatial entropy H = -Σ p_i log(p_i) where p_i are the
      soft-argmax attention weights for the proposed dimension.
   c. Normalize: H_norm = H / H_max where H_max = log(N_spatial).
   d. Gate requires H_norm < 0.50 (spatially concentrated attention).
   e. This tests whether spatial concentration provides a complementary
      distractor-rejection signal beyond prediction-trend alone.

4. Run a transition sweep (5 matched seeds: 42, 123, 456, 789, 1337) with
   N=3→4 object introduction. Measure: recruitment rate, centroid decoding
   MSE, test simulation loss.

5. Run a Noisy-TV control sweep (same 5 seeds) replacing the 4th object
   with a localized Noisy-TV pixel distractor. Measure: false recruitment
   rate, centroid MSE (should be high/meaningless for false recruitments).

6. Compare Arms P, S, T using Welch's t-test on false recruitment rate and
   centroid MSE. Report mean ± std for all metrics.

Files to modify:
- src/thalamus.py: Add prediction-trend gate logic, per-step error buffering
  during WUP, improvement ratio computation, and composite gate evaluation.
- New configuration entries for Arm S (θ=0.90) and Arm T (θ=0.90, η=0.50).
- Experimental runner script to execute both sweeps and collect metrics.
