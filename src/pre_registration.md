## 1. Hypothesis
In a dual-stream decoupled architecture, grounding the coordinate stream ($z^{coord}$) during an initial joint-training phase, followed by weight freezing (consolidation) and stop-gradient decoupling of $z^{coord}$ (Progressive Decoupling with Representational Consolidation, PDRC), will prevent semantic blindness and representation collapse while preserving high spatial localization and predictive capacity. Specifically, compared to the failed immediate-decoupling baseline (Arm D), PDRC (Arm E) will achieve a 0% collapse rate, average soft spatial variance $\le 100.0$, and a test prediction loss ratio vs the joint-training baseline (Arm A) of $\le 1.15$.

## 2. Falsification Criterion
The hypothesis will be falsified if any of the following occur over a 5-seed comparative sweep:
1. The representation collapse rate of Arm E is $> 0\%$ (where collapse is defined as test prediction loss $> 1.0$ or soft spatial variance $> 500.0$).
2. The average soft spatial variance of Arm E is $> 100.0$.
3. The ratio of the average test prediction loss of Arm E to Arm A is $\ge 1.15$.
4. The absolute correlation ($r$) of the coordinate stream with the physical object centroids is $< 0.25$, or the centroid decoding MSE is $> 85.0$ (signaling semantic blindness).

## 3. Proposed Method
1. Extend the existing codebase in `src/` to support Arm E: Progressive Decoupling with Representational Consolidation (PDRC).
2. Implement a two-stage training schedule:
   - Stage 1 (Grounding, $0 \le t < T_{ground}$): Jointly train both $z^{coord}$ (with spatial bottleneck) and $z^{dyn}$ streams with prediction gradients.
   - Stage 2 (Decoupled, $t \ge T_{ground}$): Inject a stop-gradient at the output of $z^{coord}$ before it feeds into the temporal predictor, and freeze the weights of the coordinate stream encoder. The dynamics stream and predictor continue to train.
3. Run a 5-seed sweep comparing Arm A (Gentle Bottleneck), Arm C (DSMC), Arm D (DSDT), and Arm E (PDRC) on the 1D physics sandbox.
4. Measure and log test prediction loss, soft spatial variance, centroid decoding MSE, and coordinate-centroid correlation across all arms.
