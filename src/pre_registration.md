## 1. Hypothesis
A Dynamic Surprise-Modulated Spatial Bottleneck Curriculum (DSMC)—which dynamically scales the spatial variance penalty weight $\lambda_t$ as an inverse function of the running average of local prediction surprise $\bar{S}_t$ via $\lambda_t = \lambda_{max} \cdot \exp(-\gamma \cdot \bar{S}_t)$ (where $\lambda_{max} = 0.10$, $\gamma = 10.0$, and $\bar{S}_t$ is the exponentially-weighted moving average of local temporal prediction error)—resolves the trade-off between spatial localization and cognitive predictive capacity. Specifically, across a 5-seed comparative sweep under the 1D physics sandbox with the N=3 to N=4 generalization transition, DSMC will simultaneously achieve:
1. Tight spatial localization: mean soft spatial variance of the recruited dimension $\le 120.0$ (comparable to the static strong bottleneck of $\lambda = 0.10$ which achieved $60.29$ but suffered from severe prediction degradation).
2. Superior predictive capacity: mean post-hoc centroid decoding MSE $\le 69.11$ (matching or exceeding the gentle bottleneck of $\lambda = 0.01$, which achieved $69.11$ but had large spatial spread).
3. Complete structural stability: 0.0% representation collapse rate across all 5 seeds (due to low-regularization exploration during early training phases and post-transition shock).

## 2. Falsification Criterion
The hypothesis will be falsified if the DSMC configuration:
1. Fails to achieve a mean soft spatial variance of the recruited channel $\le 120.0$ across the 5 evaluation seeds, OR
2. Fails to achieve a mean centroid decoding MSE $\le 70.0$ across the 5 evaluation seeds, OR
3. Experiences a representation collapse rate $> 0.0\%$ (any of the 5 seeds collapsing).

Curriculum Activity Sanity Check: To assert that the curriculum successfully executed, the final average penalty weight across the 5 seeds must satisfy Mean(\lambda_T) >= 0.05. If the curriculum fails to ramp up to this level of regularization but passes the other metrics, it must be reported as a failure of the curriculum to activate, not a successful resolution of the trade-off.

## 3. Proposed Method
1. Implement a local surprise tracker in the representation network module (e.g., in `src/models.py`) that computes the exponentially-weighted moving average (EWMA) of the local temporal-prediction surprise: $\bar{S}_t = \alpha \cdot \bar{S}_{t-1} + (1 - \alpha) \cdot S_t$, with smoothing factor $\alpha = 0.95$ and initialized at $1.0$.
2. Implement the DSMC controller: at each training step, calculate the dynamic spatial bottleneck penalty weight $\lambda_t = \lambda_{max} \cdot \exp(-\gamma \cdot \bar{S}_t)$, where $\lambda_{max} = 0.10$ and scaling factor $\gamma = 10.0$. This ensures that when surprise is high (early in training or immediately post-transition), $\lambda_t \to 0$ to maximize representational capacity, and as surprise decays, $\lambda_t \to 0.10$ to enforce localization.
3. Modify the training loop (e.g., in `src/train.py` or the corresponding training runner) to update, apply, and log $\lambda_t$ and $\bar{S}_t$ at each timestep.
4. Run a 5-seed comparative sweep comparing three experimental conditions:
   - Arm A (Gentle): Static bottleneck with fixed $\lambda = 0.01$.
   - Arm B (Strong): Static bottleneck with fixed $\lambda = 0.10$.
   - Arm C (Experimental): Dynamic bottleneck with DSMC ($\lambda_{max}=0.10, \gamma=10.0$).
5. Evaluate each arm on: (a) average centroid decoding MSE, (b) average soft spatial variance of the recruited channel, (c) representation collapse rate, and (d) the dynamic trajectory of $\lambda_t$ and surprise across the transition.
